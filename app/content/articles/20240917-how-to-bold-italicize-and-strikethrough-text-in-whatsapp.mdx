- `_*Bold italic*_ text` (order matters!)

### When to Use Each Style

**Bold (`*text*`):**

- Adding humor to your messages

## Quick Troubleshooting 🔧

**Characters showing up instead of formatting?**
- Make sure there are **no spaces** between the special characters and your text
- Check that you're using the correct characters (asterisk, underscore, tilde)

**Not working on certain words?**
- Some words with apostrophes or special characters might need extra attention
- Try formatting shorter phrases first to test

## The Conversation Game-Changer 🚀

These simple tricks transform ordinary messages into engaging, expressive communication! Your friends will wonder how you became such a WhatsApp wizard, and you'll enjoy the satisfaction of perfectly formatted messages.

**Imagine the possibilities:**

## Time to Practice! 💪

Ready to become a WhatsApp formatting master? Start with these practice messages:

1. Try: `*Attention everyone!* This is _really important_ information.`
2. Test: `I ~hate~ LOVE pizza with pineapple!`
3. Experiment: `Meeting at *3 PM* - _don't be late!_`

The best part? Once you start using these formatting tricks, they become second nature. Your WhatsApp game will never be the same!
