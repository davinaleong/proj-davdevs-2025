I’ve been working on the latest version of my website — **Dav/Devs 2025** — where I consolidated all my projects, articles, and microsites into a single platform. The goal was simple: make it less confusing for visitors and much easier for me to maintain and update.

One seemingly insignificant but *very* tedious part of this revamp was **content migration**.

The new site runs on **Next.js with MDX**, while my older projects were a mix of:

* Next.js with Markdown (MD)
* Astro with MD and React

Manually converting and rewriting everything would’ve been time-consuming and error-prone. That’s when Jesus gave me the idea to lean on **GenAI / vibe coding** to help with the migration.

Here’s the workflow I came up with.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Prerequisites

* **VS Code** — main IDE
* **GitHub Copilot** — AI assistant for migration
* **MDX template file** — target structure for converted content
* **Notepad++** — drafting and refining Copilot instructions

---

## ⚙️ Setup

1. Create a separate folder in `/app` to hold files to be converted, e.g.:

   ```
   /app/_import
   ```

   (The underscore pushes it to the top of the directory for easy access.)

2. Inside `/app/_import`, create an output folder:

   ```
   /app/_import/_output
   ```

   This is where the generated MDX files will go.

3. In `/public`, create subdirectories for images based on post type:

   ```
   /public/articles
   /public/projects
   /public/…
   ```

---

## 🔄 Migration Process

1. Place all old `.md` or `.mdx` files into `/app/_import`.

2. Copy all images into their respective `/public` subdirectories.

3. Open:

   * One old Markdown file
   * The MDX template file
     in VS Code side by side.

4. In Notepad++, map the old frontmatter and content structure to the new MDX template.

5. Write clear Copilot instructions in this format (with examples):

   **Goal:**
   Migrate project MD files to MDX files

   **Instructions / Tasks / TODO:**

   * Example file: `<template-file-name>`
   * File name format: `yyyymmdd-kebab-case-title.mdx`
   * `subtitle` → `description`
   * `tech stack` → blockquote in content
   * Improve clarity and flow of content
   * Update metadata to match template
   * Output directory: `/_output`

6. Send the instructions to Copilot and let it do its magic ✨ — while I reviewed the output as it was generated.

---

## ✅ Validation & Final Step

* To verify completeness, I compared the file count between:

  * `/app/_import`
  * `/app/_import/_output`

* Once everything checked out, I moved the converted files into:

  ```
  /content/<post-type>
  ```
