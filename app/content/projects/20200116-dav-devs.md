This project is [this website](https://davina-devs.com/) you're looking at right now.

> **Tech Stack**
> - **Frontend:** HTML, SASS, Font Awesome 5, GatsbyJS, ReactJS, JSON, React Markdown
> - **Deployment:** Netlify
> - **Highlights:** CSS Grid, Flex, Markdown
> - **Mockups:** Affinity Designer

This project was originally built in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), but it lacked routes. This project was moved to [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) later on. I took it as an opportunity to learn GatsbyJS. Since I had some ReactJS background, it was simple to pick up, and I got the site moved in a day.

"**Dav/Devs**" stands for Davina develops, to emphasise what I enjoy doing: building (or developing) applications.

I specialise in building websites and web applications. _Yellow_ is the main color of the `JavaScript` logo, hence my pick for it as the site's main color. The _yellow_ theme is to emphasise my transition from `PHP` to `JavaScript` as my primary language of choice for web development. I've decided I'll only use `PHP` when the project calls for the need to use a `PHP`-based application like [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x) or [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com/).

This project had 3 phases: mockup, templating and development.

I first designed the mockups in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/). It's akin to Adobe's Illustrator, and a good alternative if you don't need a subscription-based graphics software. Affinity Photo is their answer to Adobe's Photoshop.
