This is a simple [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) todo app. It's deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The main reason for me building this app is to try my hand at deployment. I wanted to learn how to deploy a LAMP stack application for as low-cost as possible. Heroku was my solution as it's free.
