I’m excited to introduce the latest version of my website — **Dav/Devs 2025** 🎉
Built with **Next.js** and **MDX**, this revamp took about **73 hours**, or roughly **10 days**, from start to finish.

> **Tech Stack**
>
> * **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS<br />
> * **Content:** MDX<br />
> * **Language:** TypeScript<br />
> * **UI & Motion:** Lucide Icons, Motion<br />
> * **Tooling:** ESLint<br />
> * **Highlights:** Dark mode, Omni-search, Animations


The goal of this rebuild was simple: to bring everything together. I consolidated content from my portfolio and various microsites into a single platform, making the site more cohesive for visitors and significantly easier for me to maintain and update.

Several familiar features have made a return, including **dark mode** and the **random original joke** feature. This time, the joke function has evolved into its own dedicated page and has been reimagined as a small game — just for fun.

There are also a number of new additions. The site now includes an **omni-search with auto-complete**, along with **search and sorting controls** on individual post listing pages. I’ve also sprinkled in some subtle animations to add a bit of life and personality to the experience.

Two new content types I especially want to highlight are **Sermons** and **Notebooks**. I chose to merge my Christian blog into Dav/Devs as a deliberate and open declaration that **Jesus is real** — and that He *is* the reason I’m able to build, create, and sustain the projects and content shared on this website.

While building the site itself was relatively straightforward (especially with the help of ChatGPT), the most time-consuming and tedious part was **content migration**. I’ve written a separate article detailing that process, which you can read here:

### Conclusion

Dav/Devs 2025 represents more than just a technical upgrade — it’s a reflection of growth, clarity, and purpose. This site now brings together my work, my learning, my creativity, and my faith in one place. Moving forward, it will serve as both a living archive and a playground for experimentation, storytelling, and sharing. I’m excited to continue building on this foundation and to see where the journey leads next.
