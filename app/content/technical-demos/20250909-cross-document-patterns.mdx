## Purpose and Scope

This file complements another document in the same test group.  
Together, they simulate realistic reuse scenarios.

### Shared Content Blocks

⚠️ DO NOT EDIT THIS PARAGRAPH  
Exact paragraph repetition across multiple documents is a common occurrence in large content systems, especially when templates, reused explanations, or shared documentation blocks are involved.

This should be detected regardless of formatting differences.

## Signal vs Noise

⚠️ DO NOT EDIT THIS PARAGRAPH  
This paragraph is designed to remain identical across multiple files so that automated scanners can verify exact matching behavior without ambiguity.

The surrounding text intentionally varies.

### Evaluation Considerations

⚠️ DO NOT EDIT THIS PARAGRAPH  
When evaluating duplicate detection systems, it is important to separate identical content from surrounding structural or stylistic differences.

This helps prevent false positives.
