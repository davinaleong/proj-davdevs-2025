# Fruits Calculator
1. Enter the number of apples you'd like to
 have.
2. Enter the number of oranges you'd like to
 have.
3. This calculator will give you the
 total number of apples and oranges you have.
```python
# Get the number of apples that the customer has bought.
```
```python
str_num_of_apples = input("Enter the number of apples you have.")
```
# Get the number of oranges that the customer has bought.
```python
str_num_of_oranges = input("Enter the number of oranges you have.")
```
# Cast the number of apples into a string
```python
num_of_apples = int(str_num_of_apples)
```
# Cast the number of oranges into a string
```python
num_of_oranges = int(str_num_of_oranges)
```
# Get the total number of fruits that the customer has
```python
num_total_fruits = num_of_apples + num_of_oranges
```
# Construct the print statement into something human-friendly
```python
str_total_fruits = f"{str_num_of_apples} apples and {str_num_of_oranges} oranges amounts to {num_total_fruits} fruits."
print(str_total_fruits)
```
```
**Output:**
