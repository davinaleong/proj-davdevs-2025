# Task: Fruit Sorting Challenge
You are given quantities of three fruits: apples, bananas, and
 oranges. Write a Python program that:
1. Takes user input for the quantity of each fruit.
2. Uses
 all six comparison operators
```python
    (==, !=, >,
    <, >=, <=) to
```
 compare the quantities.
```python
3. Uses increments (+=) and
 decrements (-=) to update a
```
    "basket counter" for each fruit.
4. Prints out:
Which fruit has the highest quantity
If any fruits have the same or different amounts
 Warnings if any fruit count is too low (≤
```python
    5) or plentiful (≥ 10)
```
5. Which fruit has the highest quantity
6. If any fruits have the same or different amounts
7. Warnings if any fruit count is too low (≤
```python
    5) or plentiful (≥ 10)
```
8. Calculates how many full baskets can be made with every
    5 units of fruit.
9. Outputs a summary of basket counts for each fruit.
```python
```python
apples = int(input('Enter the number of apples:'))
bananas = int(input('Enter the number of bananas:'))
oranges = int(input('Enter the number of oranges:'))
max_fruit_quantity = int(input('Set the **high stock threshold** (e.g. 10 or more fruits): '))
min_fruit_quantity = int(input('Set the **low stock warning** level (e.g. 5 or fewer fruits): '))
capacity = int(input('Enter the basket capacity:'))
```
# Basket counters
```python
apple_basket = 0
banana_basket = 0
orange_basket = 0
```
# Comparisons and increments
```python
print('=== Start of Fruit Comparison ===')
if apples > bananas and apples > oranges:
 print('🍎 is the most!')
 apple_basket += 1
```
elif bananas > apples and bananas > oranges:
```python
 print('🍌 is the most!')
 banana_basket += 1
```
elif oranges > apples and oranges > bananas:
```python
 print('🍊 is the most!')
 orange_basket += 1
```
else:
```python
 print('There is a tie for the most fruits!')
```
# Use of equality and inequality
```python
if apples == bananas:
 print('🍎 == 🍌')
if oranges != bananas:
 print('🍊 != 🍌')
```
# Use of >=, <=
```python
if apples >= max_fruit_quantity:
 print(f'You have at least {max_fruit_quantity} 🍎!')
if bananas >= max_fruit_quantity:
 print(f'You have at least {max_fruit_quantity} 🍌!')
if oranges >= max_fruit_quantity:
 print(f'You have at least {max_fruit_quantity} 🍊!')
if apples <= min_fruit_quantity:
 print('🍎 are running low!')
if bananas <= min_fruit_quantity:
 print('🍌 are running low!')
if oranges <= min_fruit_quantity:
 print('🍊 are running low!')
```
# Use of += incrementing baskets manually
# For every x apples, add 1 basket
```python
apple_basket += apples // capacity
banana_basket += bananas // capacity
orange_basket += oranges // capacity
```
# Summary
```python
print('=== Summary ===')
print(f'Basket capacity: {capacity}')
print(f'🍎 baskets: {apple_basket}')
print(f'🍌 baskets: {banana_basket}')
print(f'🍊 baskets: {orange_basket}')
```
```
**Output:**
```
```python
=== Start of Fruit Comparison ===
```
🍊 is the most!
```python
🍊 != 🍌
```
🍎 are running low!
🍌 are running low!
🍊 are running low!
```python
=== Summary ===
```
Basket capacity: 5
🍎 baskets: 0
🍌 baskets: 0
🍊 baskets: 1
```
