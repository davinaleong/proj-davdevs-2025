# Task: Fruit Sorting Challenge¶

You are given quantities of three fruits: apples, bananas, and
                oranges. Write a Python program that:

1. Takes user input for the quantity of each fruit.
2. Uses
                  all six comparison operators
                  (==, !=, >,
                  <, >=, <=) to
                  compare the quantities.
3. Uses increments (+=) and
                  decrements (-=) to update a
                  "basket counter" for each fruit.
4. Prints out:

Which fruit has the highest quantity
If any fruits have the same or different amounts

                      Warnings if any fruit count is too low (≤
                      5) or plentiful (≥ 10)
5. Which fruit has the highest quantity
6. If any fruits have the same or different amounts
7. Warnings if any fruit count is too low (≤
                      5) or plentiful (≥ 10)
8. Calculates how many full baskets can be made with every
                  5 units of fruit.
9. Outputs a summary of basket counts for each fruit.

```python
apples = int(input('Enter the number of apples:'))
bananas = int(input('Enter the number of bananas:'))
oranges = int(input('Enter the number of oranges:'))
max_fruit_quantity = int(input('Set the **high stock threshold** (e.g. 10 or more fruits): '))
min_fruit_quantity = int(input('Set the **low stock warning** level (e.g. 5 or fewer fruits): '))
capacity = int(input('Enter the basket capacity:'))
# Basket counters
apple_basket = 0
banana_basket = 0
orange_basket = 0
# Comparisons and increments
print('=== Start of Fruit Comparison ===')
if apples > bananas and apples > oranges:
    print('🍎 is the most!')
    apple_basket += 1
elif bananas > apples and bananas > oranges:
    print('🍌 is the most!')
    banana_basket += 1
elif oranges > apples and oranges > bananas:
    print('🍊 is the most!')
    orange_basket += 1
else:
    print('There is a tie for the most fruits!')
# Use of equality and inequality
if apples == bananas:
    print('🍎 == 🍌')
if oranges != bananas:
    print('🍊 != 🍌')
# Use of >=, <=
if apples >= max_fruit_quantity:
    print(f'You have at least {max_fruit_quantity} 🍎!')
if bananas >= max_fruit_quantity:
    print(f'You have at least {max_fruit_quantity} 🍌!')
if oranges >= max_fruit_quantity:
    print(f'You have at least {max_fruit_quantity} 🍊!')
if apples <= min_fruit_quantity:
    print('🍎 are running low!')
if bananas <= min_fruit_quantity:
    print('🍌 are running low!')
if oranges <= min_fruit_quantity:
    print('🍊 are running low!')
# Use of += incrementing baskets manually
# For every x apples, add 1 basket
apple_basket += apples // capacity
banana_basket += bananas // capacity
orange_basket += oranges // capacity
# Summary
print('=== Summary ===')
print(f'Basket capacity: {capacity}')
print(f'🍎 baskets: {apple_basket}')
print(f'🍌 baskets: {banana_basket}')
print(f'🍊 baskets: {orange_basket}')
```

**Output:**
```
=== Start of Fruit Comparison ===
🍊 is the most!
🍊 != 🍌
🍎 are running low!
🍌 are running low!
🍊 are running low!
=== Summary ===
Basket capacity: 5
🍎 baskets: 0
🍌 baskets: 0
🍊 baskets: 1
```
