# 📘 Davina's Calculator — Layperson Explanation
This notebook explains the code behind
 Davina's Calculator, written in Python.
 The calculator allows you to input two numbers, pick an
 arithmetic operation, and get a result.
## 💡 What does the code do?
Let’s break it down step by step:
### 1️⃣ Import all calculator functions
```python
from calculator import *
```
✅ This line brings in all the
 calculation functions (like add,
 subtract, multiply) from another file
 called calculator.py so we can use them here.
### 2️⃣ Print a welcome message
```python
print("== Welcome to Davina's Calculator ==")
```
✅ Displays a friendly message so the user knows they’ve opened
 the calculator program.
### 3️⃣ Get two numbers from the user
```python
x = float(input("Please give a number (decimals and negative numbers are allowed):"))
y = float(input("Please give another number (decimals and negative numbers are allowed):"))
```
✅ Asks the user to type in two numbers, which
```python
 can include decimals (like 3.5) or negatives (like -2).
```
✅ Converts the typed input into
```python
 floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals).
```
### 4️⃣ Show the list of available operations
```python
print("Here are the available arithmetic operators:")
for op_symbol, op_info in operators.items():
 name = op_info["name"]
 description = op_info["description"]
 print(f"\t'{op_symbol}' - {name}: {description}")
```
✅ Goes through a dictionary called operators that
 lists:
- The symbol (like + or
    *)
- The name (like "Add" or "Multiply")
- A short description (explaining what it does)
✅ Prints this neatly so the user can see all the choices.
### 5️⃣ Ask the user to choose an operation
```python
operator = input("Choose one:")
```
✅ Waits for the user to type in an
 operator symbol (like +,
    -, *, /, etc.).
### 6️⃣ Calculate and display the result
```python
print(calculator(x, y, operator))
```
```python
✅ Calls the calculator() function (defined
```
 elsewhere) to:
- Perform the selected calculation (like adding, subtracting,
 dividing)
- Generate a message with the result
✅ Prints the final answer for the user.
## 🎯 Summary for Non-Coders
In short, this program: ✅ Greets you ✅ Asks for two numbers ✅
 Shows you math options ✅ Lets you pick one ✅ Gives you the
 answer
All automatically — like a simple text-based calculator!
```python
```python
from calculator import *
print("== Welcome to Davina's Calculator ==")
x = float(input("Please give a number (decimals and negative numbers are allowed):"))
y = float(input("Please give another number (decimals and negative numbers are allowed):"))
print("Here are the available arithmetic operators:")
for op_symbol, op_info in operators.items():
 name = op_info["name"]
 description = op_info["description"]
 print(f"\t'{op_symbol}' - {name}: {description}")
operator = input("Choose one:")
print(calculator(x, y, operator))
```
```
**Output:**
```
```python
== Welcome to Davina's Calculator ==
```
Here are the available arithmetic operators:
	'+' - Add: Add things together
	'-' - Subtract: Take one thing away from another
```python
	'*' - Multiply: Multiply (like repeated addition)
	'/' - Divide: Divide (split into equal parts)
	'//' - Floor Division: Divide and drop the decimals (only whole number part)
	'%' - Modulus: Get what’s left over after dividing (the remainder)
	'**' - Exponentiation: Raise a number to a power (like 2 to the power of 3)
```
The remainder of 5.5 divided by 3.3 is 2.2.
```
