# 📘 Davina's Calculator — Layperson Explanation¶

This notebook explains the code behind
                Davina's Calculator, written in Python.
                The calculator allows you to input two numbers, pick an
                arithmetic operation, and get a result.

## 💡 What does the code do?¶

Let’s break it down step by step:

### 1️⃣ Import all calculator functions¶

from calculator import *

✅ This line brings in all the
                calculation functions (like add,
                subtract, multiply) from another file
                called calculator.py so we can use them here.

### 2️⃣ Print a welcome message¶

print("== Welcome to Davina's Calculator ==")

✅ Displays a friendly message so the user knows they’ve opened
                the calculator program.

### 3️⃣ Get two numbers from the user¶

x = float(input("Please give a number (decimals and negative numbers are allowed):"))
y = float(input("Please give another number (decimals and negative numbers are allowed):"))

✅ Asks the user to type in two numbers, which
                can include decimals (like 3.5) or negatives (like -2).

✅ Converts the typed input into
                floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals).

### 4️⃣ Show the list of available operations¶

print("Here are the available arithmetic operators:")
for op_symbol, op_info in operators.items():
    name = op_info["name"]
    description = op_info["description"]
    print(f"\t'{op_symbol}' - {name}: {description}")

✅ Goes through a dictionary called operators that
                lists:

- The symbol (like + or
                  *)
- The name (like "Add" or "Multiply")
- A short description (explaining what it does)

✅ Prints this neatly so the user can see all the choices.

### 5️⃣ Ask the user to choose an operation¶

operator = input("Choose one:")

✅ Waits for the user to type in an
                operator symbol (like +,
                -, *, /, etc.).

### 6️⃣ Calculate and display the result¶

print(calculator(x, y, operator))

✅ Calls the calculator() function (defined
                elsewhere) to:

- Perform the selected calculation (like adding, subtracting,
                  dividing)
- Generate a message with the result

✅ Prints the final answer for the user.

## 🎯 Summary for Non-Coders¶

In short, this program: ✅ Greets you ✅ Asks for two numbers ✅
                Shows you math options ✅ Lets you pick one ✅ Gives you the
                answer

All automatically — like a simple text-based calculator!

```python
from calculator import *
print("== Welcome to Davina's Calculator ==")
x = float(input("Please give a number (decimals and negative numbers are allowed):"))
y = float(input("Please give another number (decimals and negative numbers are allowed):"))
print("Here are the available arithmetic operators:")
for op_symbol, op_info in operators.items():
    name = op_info["name"]
    description = op_info["description"]
    print(f"\t'{op_symbol}' - {name}: {description}")
operator = input("Choose one:")
print(calculator(x, y, operator))
```

**Output:**
```
== Welcome to Davina's Calculator ==










Here are the available arithmetic operators:
	'+' - Add: Add things together
	'-' - Subtract: Take one thing away from another
	'*' - Multiply: Multiply (like repeated addition)
	'/' - Divide: Divide (split into equal parts)
	'//' - Floor Division: Divide and drop the decimals (only whole number part)
	'%' - Modulus: Get what’s left over after dividing (the remainder)
	'**' - Exponentiation: Raise a number to a power (like 2 to the power of 3)










The remainder of 5.5 divided by 3.3 is 2.2.
