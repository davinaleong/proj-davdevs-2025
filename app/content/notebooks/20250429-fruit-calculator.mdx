# Fruits Calculator¶

1. Enter the number of apples you'd like to
                  have.
2. Enter the number of oranges you'd like to
                  have.
3. This calculator will give you the
                  total number of apples and oranges you have.

```python
# Get the number of apples that the customer has bought.
str_num_of_apples = input("Enter the number of apples you have.")
# Get the number of oranges that the customer has bought.
str_num_of_oranges = input("Enter the number of oranges you have.")
# Cast the number of apples into a string
num_of_apples = int(str_num_of_apples)
# Cast the number of oranges into a string
num_of_oranges = int(str_num_of_oranges)
# Get the total number of fruits that the customer has
num_total_fruits = num_of_apples + num_of_oranges
# Construct the print statement into something human-friendly
str_total_fruits = f"{str_num_of_apples} apples and {str_num_of_oranges} oranges amounts to {num_total_fruits} fruits."
print(str_total_fruits)
```

**Output:**
```
KeyboardInterrupt
```
