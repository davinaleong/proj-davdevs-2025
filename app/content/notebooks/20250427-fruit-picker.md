## 🍓 Introduction: Making Choices with Code

Once you know how to calculate and sort data, the next step is learning how to **make decisions**.

This notebook introduces a **Fruit Picker** — a simple exercise that demonstrates how Python uses conditional logic to decide *what happens next* based on user input.

It’s where code starts to feel a little more alive.

---

## 🎯 Purpose: Learning Conditional Logic

The goal of this notebook is to help beginners understand:

- How `if` statements work in Python
- How user input can influence program flow
- How programs make decisions based on conditions
- Why control flow is essential in real applications

Almost every program you use relies on this logic.

## 🧠 How It Works: Decision-Based Flow

At a high level, the notebook follows this process:

1. Ask the user to pick a fruit
2. Compare the input against known options
3. Respond differently depending on the choice

This introduces the idea that **not all code runs all the time**.

---

## 🧩 The Technical Part: If, Elif, Else

A simplified version of the core logic looks like this:

```python
fruit = input("Pick a fruit: ")

if fruit == "apple":
    print("You picked an apple 🍎")
elif fruit == "banana":
    print("You picked a banana 🍌")
else:
    print("Fruit not recognised")
````

### 🔍 What’s Happening Here?

* The program evaluates conditions **top to bottom**
* Only the first matching condition runs
* `else` acts as a fallback for unexpected input
* User input directly affects program behaviour

This is a foundational pattern used everywhere — from forms to APIs.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways: Thinking Like a Program

This notebook teaches several important ideas:

* 🔀 Programs don’t guess — they evaluate conditions
* 🧭 Control flow determines outcomes
* 🧠 Clear conditions lead to predictable behaviour
* 🛠 Handling unexpected input is part of good design

Once this clicks, programming starts to feel logical instead of mysterious.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion: From Data to Decisions

The Fruit Picker marks an important shift:

> Your program is no longer just processing data —
> it’s responding to choices.

With conditionals mastered, you’re ready to explore:

* Loops
* Functions
* Validation
* More complex user interactions

Every smart program starts with a simple `if`.
