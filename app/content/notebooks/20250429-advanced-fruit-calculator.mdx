# 🍍 Project: Fruit Shop Calculator
## 🎯 Objective:
Simulate a simple fruit shop checkout where you:
- Add and subtract quantities
- Multiply for total cost
- Divide to find average price
- Use modulus %, exponentiation **,
 and floor division // for calculations
## 🧾 Task Description:
You're buying:
- 3 apples at SGD2 each
- 5 bananas at SGD1.5 each
- 4 durians at SGD15 each
You're also running a promotion:
- You get 1 free apple for every 2 bought
- Apply a 9% tax
- Show average price per fruit
- Show cost per fruit rounded down and leftover cents
# Starter code from ChatGPT
# Fruit prices
```python
apple_price = 2
banana_price = 1.5
durian_price = 15
```
# Quantities
```python
apples_bought = 3
bananas_bought = 5
durians_bought = 4
```
# Free apples
```python
free_apples = apples_bought // 2  # 1 free for every 2 bought
total_apples = apples_bought + free_apples
```
# Total cost before tax
```python
cost = (apples_bought * apple_price) + (bananas_bought * banana_price) + (durians_bought * durian_price)
```
# Apply tax (9%)
```python
tax_rate = 0.09
tax_amount = cost * tax_rate
total_cost = cost + tax_amount
```
# Average price per fruit (including free apples)
```python
total_fruits = total_apples + bananas_bought + durians_bought
average_price = total_cost / total_fruits
```
# Floor division and modulus for durian price
```python
dollar_part = durian_price // 1
cent_part = durian_price % 1
```
# Exponentiation (bonus): Square the number of bananas
```python
banana_power = bananas_bought ** 2
```
# Print results
```python
print(f"Free apples: {free_apples}")
print(f"Total cost after tax: ${total_cost:.2f}")
print(f"Average price per fruit: ${average_price:.2f}")
print(f"Durian cost split: ${dollar_part} + {cent_part*100:.0f} cents")
print(f"Bananas to the power of 2: {banana_power}")
```
The next section accepts user input to function as a practical
 fruit cost calculator.
```python
# Inputs for fruit prices
```python
str_apple_price = input('Enter the price of a single apple: ')
str_banana_price = input('Enter the price of a single banana: ')
str_durian_price = input('Enter the price of a single durian: ')
```
# Inputs for fruits bought
```python
str_apples_bought = input('How many apples did you buy? ')
str_bananas_bought = input('How many bananas did you buy? ')
str_durians_bought = input('How many durians did you buy? ')
```
# Fruit prices
```python
apple_price = float(str_apple_price)
banana_price = float(str_banana_price)
durian_price = float(str_durian_price)
```
# Quantities
```python
apples_bought = int(str_apples_bought)
bananas_bought = int(str_bananas_bought)
durians_bought = int(str_durians_bought)
```
# Free apples
```python
free_apples = apples_bought // 2  # 1 free for every 2 bought
total_apples = apples_bought + free_apples
```
# Total cost before tax
```python
cost = (apples_bought * apple_price) + (bananas_bought * banana_price) + (durians_bought * durian_price)
```
# Apply tax (9%)
```python
tax_rate = 0.09
tax_amount = cost * tax_rate
total_cost = cost + tax_amount
```
# Average price per fruit (including free apples)
```python
total_fruits = total_apples + bananas_bought + durians_bought
average_price = total_cost / total_fruits
```
# Floor division and modulus for durian price
```python
dollar_part = durian_price // 1
cent_part = durian_price % 1
```
# Exponentiation (bonus): Square the number of bananas
```python
banana_power = bananas_bought ** 2
```
# Print results
```python
print(f"\n=== Fruit Shop Summary ===")
print(f"Free apples received: {free_apples}")
print(f"Total cost after 9% tax: SGD{total_cost:.2f}")
print(f"Average price per fruit: SGD{average_price:.2f}")
print(f"Durian price breakdown: SGD{int(dollar_part)} and {int(cent_part * 100)} cents")
print(f"Bananas squared: {banana_power}")
```
```
**Output:**
```
```python
=== Fruit Shop Summary ===
```
Free apples received: 6
Total cost after 9% tax: SGD148.78
Average price per fruit: SGD4.96
Durian price breakdown: SGD15 and 0 cents
Bananas squared: 25
```
