# 📚 Simple Library Management System
This is a beginner-friendly project made with
 Python in Jupyter Notebook. It helps you
 practice using:
- ✅ Lists
- ✅ Tuples
- ✅ Sets
- ✅ Dictionaries
- ✅ Nested data (like a list inside a dictionary)
## 🎯 What This Project Does
You’ll build a small system to:
1. Store book info like title and author
2. Track users and which books they borrowed
3. Show available books
4. Let users borrow or return books
5. Learn core Python data types
## 🛠️ What You’ll Learn
Python Concept
What You’ll Use It For
List
To track borrowed books
Tuple
```python
To store book details (title, author)
```
Set
To collect unique genres
Dictionary
To store books and user info
Nested data A dictionary with lists or tuples
## 📋 Steps in the Notebook
1. Create a book list using a dictionary:
```python
books = {
  "B001": ("The Alchemist", "Paulo Coelho", "Fiction"),
  "B002": ("1984", "George Orwell", "Dystopian")
```
}
1. Track users and what they borrowed:
```python
users = {
```
  "alice": ["B001"],
  "bob": []
}
1. Get unique genres using a set:
```python
genres = set(book[2] for book in books.values())
```
1. Make simple functions:
- View all books
- Borrow a book
- Return a book
1. Add a menu using a while loop:
```python
while True:
 print("1. View Books\n2. Borrow\n3. Return\n4. Exit")
 choice = input("Choose an option: ")
```
# 📚 Welcome to Davina's Library Code Walkthrough
This Python program simulates a small library system. It
 organizes a collection of books by their genres and displays
 them in an easy-to-read format.
## 🏷️ Library Name
```python
library = "Davina's Library"
print(f"=== Welcome to {library} ===")
```
We start by setting the name of the library and printing a welcome message. The {library} part gets replaced
 with the actual name.
## 📖 Book Collection
```python
books = {
    "B001": ("The Alchemist", "Paulo Coelho", "Fiction"),
```
    ...
}
- This is a dictionary where each book has a unique ID like "B001".
- Each book's value is a tuple containing:
The title of the book
The author’s name
The genre it belongs to
- The title of the book
- The author’s name
- The genre it belongs to
Think of it like a library record card for each book.
## 🗂️ Genres
```python
genres = {
```
    "Fiction",
    "Dystopian",
    ...
}
This is a set of all the different book genres.
```python
 Sets are used when we only want unique values (no duplicates).
```
## 🧩 Grouping Books by Genre
```python
books_by_genre = {}
```
We create an empty dictionary to store books
 sorted by genre.
### 🔄 Looping Through the Books
```python
for book_id, (title, author, genre) in books.items():
 if genre not in books_by_genre:
 books_by_genre[genre] = []
 books_by_genre[genre].append(book_id)
```
- This loop checks each book’s genre.
- If the genre isn’t in the dictionary yet, it creates a new
 list for that genre.
- Then, it adds the book ID to the list under the correct genre.
## 📋 Displaying the Books
```python
for genre, book_uuids in books_by_genre.items():
 print(f"\n📚 Genre: {genre}")
 for book_uuid in book_uuids:
 title, author, _ = books[book_uuid]
 print(f"  - {book_uuid}: {title} by {author}")
```
This section prints each genre followed by a list of books under
 that category, including their:
- Book ID
- Title
- Author
### ✅ Example Output
```
📚 Genre: Fiction
  - B001: The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho
📚 Genre: Classic
  - B003: To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
  - B004: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
```
## 💡 Summary
This code teaches:
- How to store and access book info using dictionaries and
 tuples
- How to avoid duplicate genres using a set
- How to organize data using loops and nested structures
Perfect for beginners building a simple but structured Python
 project!
# 👤 User Management in Davina's Library
This section of the Python program manages the
 library users and shows what books they've
 borrowed. It interacts with users by asking for their name and
 displaying their borrowed books if they're registered.
## 📇 User Data
```python
users = {
```
    "alice": ["B001", "B005"],
    "bob": [],
    "charlie": ["B007"],
    "diana": ["B003", "B010"],
    "ethan": ["B006"]
}
- This is a dictionary where each key is a user name.
- Each user has a list of book IDs they’ve
 borrowed.
- If the list is empty ([]), the user hasn't
 borrowed any books yet.
Think of it like each user has a folder with a list of
 borrowed book IDs inside.
## 👀 Show All Users
```python
print(f"--- Users of {library} ---")
for user in users:
 print(f"- {user}")
```
- Prints out a list of all users in the system.
- Helpful for testing or verifying who is registered.
## 🧾 User Login and Borrowed Books Check
```python
user = input("Please enter your name:")
user_input = str(user).lower()
```
- Asks the user to type their name.
- Converts the name to lowercase so the check is
```python
 case-insensitive (e.g., Alice =
```
 alice).
### ✅ If the User Exists
```python
if user_input in users:
 print(f"Welcome back, {user}:")
```
- Checks if the entered name is already in the
 users dictionary.
### 📚 Show Borrowed Books
```python
borrowed_book_uuids = users[user_input]
```
```python
if borrowed_book_uuids:
 print("You have borrowed the following books:")
```
```python
 for borrowed_book_uuid in borrowed_book_uuids:
        (title, author, genre) = books[borrowed_book_uuid]
 print(f"  - {borrowed_book_uuid}: {title} by {author}, {genre}")
```
- Retrieves the list of book IDs the user has borrowed.
- For each book ID, it looks up the
 book title, author, and genre from the
 books dictionary.
- Prints the full book info in a friendly format.
### ❌ If the User is Not Found
else:
```python
 print(f"User '{user}' not found. Please register first.")
```
- This message is shown when someone who isn't in the system
 tries to log in.

# 🔁 Borrow & Return System — Davina's Library
This part of the program allows registered users to
 borrow or return books using simple commands.
 It includes a basic menu and checks to ensure everything is
 valid.
## 🖥️ System Startup
```python
print(f"--- {library} Borrow/Return System ---")
```
- Displays a title for the borrow/return section of the system.
- {library} refers to the library name you set
 earlier.
## 🧾 Available Actions
```python
actions = ("borrow", "return")
```
- A tuple that defines two options:
    "borrow" or "return".
- These options are used later to decide what the user wants to
 do.
## 👤 Ask for User Name
```python
user = input("Please enter your name:")
user_input = str(user).lower()
```
- Gets the user’s name as input.
- Converts the name to lowercase so it matches stored names
 regardless of capitalization.
## 🔐 Check If User Is Registered
```python
if user_input in users:
```
- Looks for the user in the system.
- If the user exists, they can continue to borrow or return
 books.
## 🧭 Choose an Action
```python
print(f"Available options: {actions}")
action = input("Please enter your choice (borrow/return): ").lower()
```
- Displays available actions.
- Asks the user what they want to do.
## 📚 If the User Chooses to Borrow
```python
if action == actions[0]:
```
- Shows books grouped by genre.
- Each book is displayed with its ID, title, and author.
```python
book_uuid = input("Which book would you like to borrow?")
```
- Asks for the book’s ID.
```python
if book_uuid in books and book_uuid not in users[user_input]:
 users[user_input].append(book_uuid)
```
    ...
- Confirms the book exists and isn’t already borrowed by the
 user.
- Adds the book to the user’s list of borrowed books.
## 📤 If the User Chooses to Return
```python
elif action == actions[1]:
```
- Lists all books the user has borrowed.
```python
book_uuid = input("Which book would you like to return?")
```
- Asks which book the user wants to return.
```python
if book_uuid in borrowed_book_uuids:
 borrowed_book_uuids.remove(book_uuid)
```
- Removes the returned book from the user’s borrowed list.
## 🛑 Error Handling
else:
```python
 print(f"Invalid action '{action}'.")
```
- Shows an error if the user types anything other than "borrow"
 or "return".
else:
```python
 print(f"User '{user}' not found. Please register first.")
```
- If the user isn’t in the system, it prompts them to register.
