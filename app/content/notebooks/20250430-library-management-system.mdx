# 📚 Simple Library Management System¶

This is a beginner-friendly project made with
                Python in Jupyter Notebook. It helps you
                practice using:

- ✅ Lists
- ✅ Tuples
- ✅ Sets
- ✅ Dictionaries
- ✅ Nested data (like a list inside a
                  dictionary)

## 🎯 What This Project Does¶

You’ll build a small system to:

1. Store book info like title and author
2. Track users and which books they borrowed
3. Show available books
4. Let users borrow or return books
5. Learn core Python data types

## 🛠️ What You’ll Learn¶

Python Concept
What You’ll Use It For

List
To track borrowed books

Tuple
To store book details (title, author)

Set
To collect unique genres

Dictionary
To store books and user info

Nested data
A dictionary with lists or tuples

## 📋 Steps in the Notebook¶

1. Create a book list using a dictionary:

books = {
  "B001": ("The Alchemist", "Paulo Coelho", "Fiction"),
  "B002": ("1984", "George Orwell", "Dystopian")
}

1. Track users and what they borrowed:

users = {
  "alice": ["B001"],
  "bob": []
}

1. Get unique genres using a set:

genres = set(book[2] for book in books.values())

1. Make simple functions:

- View all books
- Borrow a book
- Return a book

1. Add a menu using a while loop:

while True:
    print("1. View Books\n2. Borrow\n3. Return\n4. Exit")
    choice = input("Choose an option: ")

# 📚 Welcome to Davina's Library Code Walkthrough¶

This Python program simulates a small library system. It
                organizes a collection of books by their genres and displays
                them in an easy-to-read format.

## 🏷️ Library Name¶

library = "Davina's Library"
print(f"=== Welcome to {library} ===")

We start by setting the name of the library and printing a
                welcome message. The {library} part gets replaced
                with the actual name.

## 📖 Book Collection¶

books = {
    "B001": ("The Alchemist", "Paulo Coelho", "Fiction"),
    ...
}

- This is a dictionary where each book has a
                  unique ID like "B001".
- Each book's value is a tuple containing:

The title of the book
The author’s name
The genre it belongs to
- The title of the book
- The author’s name
- The genre it belongs to

Think of it like a library record card for each book.

## 🗂️ Genres¶

genres = {
    "Fiction",
    "Dystopian",
    ...
}

This is a set of all the different book genres.
                Sets are used when we only want unique values (no duplicates).

## 🧩 Grouping Books by Genre¶

books_by_genre = {}

We create an empty dictionary to store books
                sorted by genre.

### 🔄 Looping Through the Books¶

for book_id, (title, author, genre) in books.items():
    if genre not in books_by_genre:
        books_by_genre[genre] = []
    books_by_genre[genre].append(book_id)

- This loop checks each book’s genre.
- If the genre isn’t in the dictionary yet, it creates a new
                  list for that genre.
- Then, it adds the book ID to the list under the correct genre.

## 📋 Displaying the Books¶

for genre, book_uuids in books_by_genre.items():
    print(f"\n📚 Genre: {genre}")
    for book_uuid in book_uuids:
        title, author, _ = books[book_uuid]
        print(f"  - {book_uuid}: {title} by {author}")

This section prints each genre followed by a list of books under
                that category, including their:

- Book ID
- Title
- Author

### ✅ Example Output¶

```
📚 Genre: Fiction
  - B001: The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho

📚 Genre: Classic
  - B003: To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
  - B004: The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
```

## 💡 Summary¶

This code teaches:

- How to store and access book info using dictionaries and
                  tuples
- How to avoid duplicate genres using a set
- How to organize data using loops and nested structures

Perfect for beginners building a simple but structured Python
                project!

# 👤 User Management in Davina's Library¶

This section of the Python program manages the
                library users and shows what books they've
                borrowed. It interacts with users by asking for their name and
                displaying their borrowed books if they're registered.

## 📇 User Data¶

users = {
    "alice": ["B001", "B005"],
    "bob": [],
    "charlie": ["B007"],
    "diana": ["B003", "B010"],
    "ethan": ["B006"]
}

- This is a dictionary where each key is a
                  user name.
- Each user has a list of book IDs they’ve
                  borrowed.
- If the list is empty ([]), the user hasn't
                  borrowed any books yet.

Think of it like each user has a folder with a list of
                  borrowed book IDs inside.

## 👀 Show All Users¶

print(f"--- Users of {library} ---")
for user in users:
    print(f"- {user}")

- Prints out a list of all users in the system.
- Helpful for testing or verifying who is registered.

## 🧾 User Login and Borrowed Books Check¶

user = input("Please enter your name:")
user_input = str(user).lower()

- Asks the user to type their name.
- Converts the name to lowercase so the check is
                  case-insensitive (e.g., Alice =
                  alice).

### ✅ If the User Exists¶

if user_input in users:
    print(f"Welcome back, {user}:")

- Checks if the entered name is already in the
                  users dictionary.

### 📚 Show Borrowed Books¶

borrowed_book_uuids = users[user_input]

if borrowed_book_uuids:
    print("You have borrowed the following books:")

    for borrowed_book_uuid in borrowed_book_uuids:
        (title, author, genre) = books[borrowed_book_uuid]
        print(f"  - {borrowed_book_uuid}: {title} by {author}, {genre}")

- Retrieves the list of book IDs the user has borrowed.
- For each book ID, it looks up the
                  book title, author, and genre from the
                  books dictionary.
- Prints the full book info in a friendly format.

### ❌ If the User is Not Found¶

else:
    print(f"User '{user}' not found. Please register first.")

- This message is shown when someone who isn't in the system
                  tries to log in.

## 💡 Summary¶

This code helps beginners understand:

Concept
Purpose

dict
To store users and what they’ve borrowed

list
To keep track of each user’s borrowed books

input()
To get the user’s name

for loop
To print lists of users and books

if statement
To check if the user exists and what they borrowed

# 🔁 Borrow & Return System — Davina's Library¶

This part of the program allows registered users to
                borrow or return books using simple commands.
                It includes a basic menu and checks to ensure everything is
                valid.

## 🖥️ System Startup¶

print(f"--- {library} Borrow/Return System ---")

- Displays a title for the borrow/return section of the system.
- {library} refers to the library name you set
                  earlier.

## 🧾 Available Actions¶

actions = ("borrow", "return")

- A tuple that defines two options:
                  "borrow" or "return".
- These options are used later to decide what the user wants to
                  do.

## 👤 Ask for User Name¶

user = input("Please enter your name:")
user_input = str(user).lower()

- Gets the user’s name as input.
- Converts the name to lowercase so it matches stored names
                  regardless of capitalization.

## 🔐 Check If User Is Registered¶

if user_input in users:

- Looks for the user in the system.
- If the user exists, they can continue to borrow or return
                  books.

## 🧭 Choose an Action¶

print(f"Available options: {actions}")
action = input("Please enter your choice (borrow/return): ").lower()

- Displays available actions.
- Asks the user what they want to do.

## 📚 If the User Chooses to Borrow¶

if action == actions[0]:

- Shows books grouped by genre.
- Each book is displayed with its ID, title, and author.

book_uuid = input("Which book would you like to borrow?")

- Asks for the book’s ID.

if book_uuid in books and book_uuid not in users[user_input]:
    users[user_input].append(book_uuid)
    ...

- Confirms the book exists and isn’t already borrowed by the
                  user.
- Adds the book to the user’s list of borrowed books.

## 📤 If the User Chooses to Return¶

elif action == actions[1]:

- Lists all books the user has borrowed.

book_uuid = input("Which book would you like to return?")

- Asks which book the user wants to return.

if book_uuid in borrowed_book_uuids:
    borrowed_book_uuids.remove(book_uuid)

- Removes the returned book from the user’s borrowed list.

## 🛑 Error Handling¶

else:
    print(f"Invalid action '{action}'.")

- Shows an error if the user types anything other than "borrow"
                  or "return".

else:
    print(f"User '{user}' not found. Please register first.")

- If the user isn’t in the system, it prompts them to register.

                | tuple | Stores fixed choices
                (borrow, return) | |
