## ❌⭕ Introduction: A Classic Game in Code

Tic Tac Toe is one of those projects that almost every programmer builds at least once — and for good reason.

Despite its simplicity, the game requires clear **logic**, **rules**, and **state tracking**, making it an excellent way to practice core programming concepts in a fun and familiar context.

This notebook implements a playable Tic Tac Toe game using Python.

---

## 🎯 Purpose: Practising Logic and Flow

The goal of this notebook is to help learners understand how to:

- Represent a game board in code
- Track player turns
- Validate user input
- Check win and draw conditions
- Control the flow of a game from start to finish

It’s less about fancy features, and more about **thinking clearly**.

## 🧠 How It Works: Game Loop Thinking

At a high level, the game follows this flow:

1. Initialise an empty game board
2. Display the board to the players
3. Alternate turns between players
4. Update the board after each move
5. Check for a winner or a draw
6. End the game when a condition is met

This introduces the idea of a **game loop**, a pattern used widely in interactive programs.

## 🧩 The Technical Part: Board, Turns, and Rules

A simplified example of the board representation might look like this:

```python
board = [" ", " ", " ",
         " ", " ", " ",
         " ", " ", " "]
````

And a basic win check:

```python
def check_winner(board):
    win_conditions = [
        (0,1,2), (3,4,5), (6,7,8),
        (0,3,6), (1,4,7), (2,5,8),
        (0,4,8), (2,4,6)
    ]

    for a, b, c in win_conditions:
        if board[a] == board[b] == board[c] != " ":
            return True
    return False
```

### 🔍 What This Demonstrates

* 🎯 Clear rule definition
* 🔁 Repeated checks inside a loop
* 🧠 State stored and updated over time
* 🛡 Validation to prevent invalid moves

These patterns show up in many real-world applications.

## 💡 Key Takeaways: Why This Project Matters

This notebook reinforces several important skills:

* 🧠 Translating rules into logic
* 🔄 Managing state changes
* 🧱 Breaking problems into smaller functions
* 🎮 Designing interactive programs

Many developers remember this as the project where things “clicked”.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion: Small Game, Big Learning

The **Tic Tac Toe** notebook is more than just a game:

> It’s an exercise in clarity, structure, and logical thinking.

With this project complete, learners are well prepared to explore:

* Larger game logic
* Menu-driven programs
* AI opponents
* Object-oriented refactors

Every complex system starts with simple rules — just like Tic Tac Toe.
