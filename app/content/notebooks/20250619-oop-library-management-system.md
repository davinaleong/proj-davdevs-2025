## 📚 Introduction: From Objects to Systems

After learning how to model simple objects with classes, the next step is learning how **objects interact to form a system**.

This notebook introduces an **OOP-based Library Management System**, applying object-oriented principles to represent books, libraries, and actions such as borrowing and returning. It’s a meaningful step from isolated classes to coordinated behaviour.

This is where OOP starts to feel practical.

---

## 🎯 Purpose: Applying OOP to Real Scenarios

The goal of this notebook is to help learners understand how to:

- Model real-world entities as classes
- Separate responsibilities across objects
- Use methods to control system behaviour
- Manage state through object interactions

Rather than focusing on syntax, this notebook focuses on **design thinking**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works: Object Interactions

At a high level, the system is designed around multiple objects:

1. A `Book` class to represent individual books
2. A `Library` class to manage collections of books
3. Methods to borrow and return books
4. Internal state tracking for availability

Each object has a clear role, and the system emerges from their interaction.

## 🧩 The Technical Part: Classes and Responsibilities

A simplified version of the structure looks like this:

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title
        self.is_borrowed = False
````

```python
class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []

    def borrow_book(self, title):
        for book in self.books:
            if book.title == title and not book.is_borrowed:
                book.is_borrowed = True
                print("Book borrowed")
                return
        print("Book not available")
```

### 🔍 What This Demonstrates

* 🧱 Classes encapsulate both data and behaviour
* 🔁 Objects collaborate to enforce rules
* 🧠 State lives inside objects, not global variables
* 🛠 Methods act as controlled entry points

This mirrors how backend systems are structured.

## 💡 Key Takeaways: Why OOP Shines Here

This notebook reinforces key object-oriented ideas:

* 📦 Objects represent real-world entities
* 🧭 Responsibilities are clearly defined
* 🔄 State changes are controlled and predictable
* 🧠 Systems become easier to extend and reason about

This is exactly why OOP is widely used in large applications.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion: Designing with Objects

The **OOP Library Management System** represents a major conceptual shift:

> You’re no longer just writing code —
> you’re designing a system of collaborating objects.

With this foundation, learners are ready to explore:

* Inheritance (e.g. different book types)
* User objects and permissions
* Persistence (saving data)
* Full application architectures

This notebook is a strong signal of **software design maturity**.
