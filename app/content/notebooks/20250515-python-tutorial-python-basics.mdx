# Question 1: Check if a number is Palindrome* or not [10%]¶

Suggestion: Complete IU 3.5.5 before attempting this question.

1 a) Write a code snippet for user to input a number. [2%]

1 b) Run a check to see if the input is a number or a string, if
                user input a string, display out a message showing, "Incorrect
                format, please input a number." [4%]

1 c) Once the user inputs a number, run a check to see if the
                number is palindrome or not. If the number is palindrome display
                "The given number is Palindrome". If it's not a palindrome, then
                display, "The given number is not a Palindrome." [4%]

Examples:

- input: "bib": output: Incorrect format, please input a number.
- input: "415": output: The given number is not a Palindrome.
- input: "212": output: The given number is Palindrome.

* A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its
                digits are reversed. In other words, it reads the same backward
                as forward. Palindrome numbers are symmetric and exhibit the
                same sequence of digits when read from left to right and from
                right to left.

# Question 2: Frequently occurring words [10%]¶

Suggestion: Complete IU 3.5.6 before attempting this question.

2 a) Implement a function that takes a string text and an
                integer k. [2%]

2 b) Checks the occurrence of each word in the sentence. [3%]

2 c) Returns the list of words that occur in the text at least k
                times. [3%]

2 d) The words must be returned in the order of their first
                occurrence in the text. [2%]

Example:

- input: text = "a mouse is smaller than a dog but a dog is
                  stronger"
- k = 2
- output: ['a', 'is', 'dog']

Explanation: The list of words that occur at least k = 2 times
                is ["a", "is", "dog"]. "a" occurs 3 times, "is" and "dog" both
                occur 2 times. No other word occurs at least 2 times. The answer
                is in order of the first appearance in text.

# Question 3: Suffix stripping Stemmer* [10%]¶

Suggestion: Complete IU 3.5.6 before attempting this question.

3 a) Implement a function that takes a sentence without
                punctuation. [1%]

3 b) If the word ends in 'ed', 'ly' or 'ing', remove the suffix.
                [4%]

3 c) If the resulting word is longer than 7 letters, keep the
                first 7 letters. [3%]

3 d) Return the stemmed counterpart of individual words as a
                string. [2%]

Example:

- input: text = "an extremely ferocious dog is barking"
- output: an extreme ferocio dog is bark

Explanation:

'an' does not end in one of the suffixes and is less than 7
                letters, 'extremely' is 'extreme' after removing the suffix and
                'extreme' is less than 7 letters, 'ferocious' is 9 letters long,
                so reduce it to 7 letters: 'ferocio','dog' and 'is' are
                unchanged, 'barking' is 'bark' after removing the suffix and is
                less than 7 letters.

* Stemming is the process of extracting the base word from a
                word. For instance, the base for "worked" is "work".

# Question 4: Scientific Calculator [10%]¶

Suggestion: Complete IU 3.5.7 before attempting this question.

4 a) Implement a function to create a simple scientific
                calculator. [2%]

4 b) The operations that can be performed are: [7%]

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Exponential
- Square root
- Logarithm
- Sin
- Cosine
- Tan

4 c) Return the results after computing the selected operation.
                [1%]

```python
try:
    x = int(input("Please give a number:"))
    str_x = f"{x}"
    str_x_reverse = str_x[::-1]
    if str_x == str_x_reverse:
        print(f"The given number is Palindrome.")
    else:
        print(f"The given number is not a Palindrome.")
except ValueError:
    print("Incorrect format, please input a number.")
```

**Output:**
```
The given number is Palindrome.
```

```python
def frequent_words(text, k):
    # 2a: Split the text into words
    words = text.split(" ")
    # 2b: Count word occurrences
    word_counts = {}
    for word in words:
        word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    # 2c + 2d: Collect words with count ≥ k in order of first appearance
    result = []
    for word in words:
        if word_counts[word] >= k and word not in result:
            result.append(word)
    return result
text = "a mouse is smaller than a dog but a dog is stronger"
k = 2
print(frequent_words(text, k))
```

**Output:**
```
['a', 'is', 'dog']
```

```python
sentence = input("Give a sentence without a punctuation:")
def stemming(text):
    separator = " "
    suffixes = ("ed", "ly", "ing")
    max_word_length = 7
    words = text.split(separator)
    result_words = []
    for word in words:
        # Step 1: Remove suffix if present
        if word.endswith("ing"):
            word = word[:-3]
        elif word.endswith(("ed", "ly")):
            word = word[:-2]
        # Step 2: Truncate if longer than max_word_length
        if len(word) > max_word_length:
            word = word[:max_word_length]
        result_words.append(word)
    result = separator.join(result_words)
    return result
print(stemming(sentence))
```

**Output:**
```
an extreme ferocio dog is bark
```
