# 📊 Davina's Calculator Notebook Summary¶

This Jupyter Notebook builds a
                simple calculator in Python using arithmetic
                operations, structured into three main sections (cells).

## 🟡 Cell 1: Basic Arithmetic Functions¶

Defines core functions for:

- Addition (add)
- Subtraction (subtract)
- Multiplication (multiply)
- Division (divide) — with
                  ZeroDivisionError handling
- Floor Division (floorDivision) — with
                  ZeroDivisionError handling
- Modulus (modulus) — with
                  ZeroDivisionError handling
- Exponentiation (exponentiation)

At the end, it tests these functions with
                x = 5 and y = 3, printing the results.

## 🟠 Cell 2: Calculator Function¶

Creates a wrapper function
calculator(x, y, operator) that:

- Checks if the operator is valid.
- Routes to the correct arithmetic function based on the
                  operator:

                      Handles /, //,
                      % inside a try block (due to
                      possible division by zero).

                      Handles +, -, *,
                      ** directly.
- Handles /, //,
                      % inside a try block (due to
                      possible division by zero).
- Handles +, -, *,
                      ** directly.
- Returns a human-readable message describing
                  the operation result.

Then it runs test calls for each operator,
                again using x = 5 and y = 3.

## 🟢
                Cell 3: Operator Dictionary + User Interaction¶

Defines an operators dictionary that:

- Maps each operator symbol to its name and
                  layperson-friendly description.

Then:

- Greets the user.
- Prompts the user to input two numbers.
- Lists all available operators with their descriptions.
- Prompts the user to choose an operator.
- Runs the calculator() function with the user’s
                  inputs and prints the result.

## 💡 Key Takeaways¶

✅ Error handling for division by zero
                ✅ Clear separation between low-level arithmetic functions and
                high-level calculator logic
                ✅ Friendly user prompts and operator explanations
                ✅ Good modular design for easy expansion later

## 🟡 Cell 1: Define Basic Arithmetic Functions¶

This cell defines individual functions for basic arithmetic
                operations
                (add, subtract, multiply, divide, floor division, modulus,
                exponentiation)
                and runs test calculations using example numbers.

## 🟠 Cell 2: Build Calculator Wrapper Function¶

This cell defines the
                calculator(x, y, operator) function,
                which selects the correct arithmetic function based on the
                chosen operator
                and returns a friendly result message; it also runs test cases
                for all operators.

## 🟢 Cell 3: Set Up Operator Info and User Interaction¶

This cell creates a dictionary of operators with their names and
                descriptions,
                displays available operations to the user, takes user input for
                numbers and operator,
                and runs the calculator to display the final result.

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y
def divide(x, y):
    result = 0
    try:
        return x / y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: you can't divide by zero!")
def floorDivision(x, y):
    try:
        return x // y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: you can't divide by zero!")
def modulus(x, y):
    try:
        return x % y
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: you can't divide by zero!")
def exponentiation(x, y):
    return x ** y
# Test functions
x = 5
y = 3
print("== Start: Test Calculation Functions ==")
print(f"Add {x} and {y}:", add(x, y))
print(f"Subtract {x} from {y}:", subtract(x, y))
print(f"Multiply {x} and {y}:", multiply(x, y))
print(f"Divide {x} by {y}:", divide(x, y))
print(f"Floor divide {x} from {y}:", floorDivision(x, y))
print(f"Find the remainder of {x} from {y}:", modulus(x, y))
print(f"Find the exponent of {x} from {y}:", exponentiation(x, y))
print("== End: Test Calculation Functions ==")
```

**Output:**
```

	'-' - Subtract: Take one thing away from another
	'*' - Multiply: Multiply (like repeated addition)
	'/' - Divide: Divide (split into equal parts)
	'//' - Floor Division: Divide and drop the decimals (only whole number part)
	'%' - Modulus: Get what’s left over after dividing (the remainder)

5.5 multiplied by 3.3 is 18.15.
