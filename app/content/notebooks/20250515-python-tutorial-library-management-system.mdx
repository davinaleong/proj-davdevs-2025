# Building a Library Management System [10%]
Suggestion: Complete IU 3.6.9.1 before attempting this question.
You are tasked with building a library management system using
 Python classes and objects. The system should allow for the
 management of books, library members, and borrowing
 transactions. Here are the requirements:
1. Create a class called Book with the following attributes and
 methods: [2%]
- Attributes: title, author, isbn, copies_available,
 total_copies
- Method: display_info() that displays information about the
 book.
1. Create a class called Member with the following attributes and
 methods: [3%]
- Attributes: name, member_id, books_borrowed (a list of books
 borrowed)
- Method: borrow_book(book) that allows a member to borrow a book.
- Method: return_book(book) that allows a member to return a book.
1. Create a class called Library with the following attributes
 and methods: [5%]
- Attributes: name, books (a list of books), members (a list of
 members)
- Method: add_book(book) to add a book to the library.
- Method: add_member(member) to add a member to the library.
- Method: get_available_books() to get a list of books available
```python
 for borrowing.
```
- Method: get_borrowed_books() to get a list of borrowed books.
- Method: get_member_books(member) to get a list of books
 borrowed by a member.
Your goal is to create the above class hierarchy and implement
 the methods to demonstrate interactions between books, members,
 and the library.
Test your classes by creating instances, adding books and
 members, and simulating borrowing and returning transactions.
This code defines three core classes for a simple Library
 Management System:
- Book: Represents a book with details such as title, author,
 ISBN, available copies, and total copies. Includes a method
 to display book information.
- Member: Represents a library member with a name, ID, and a list
 of borrowed books. Provides methods to borrow and return
 books, with appropriate messages.
- Library: Represents a library with a name, and collections of
 books and members. Includes methods to add books and
 members, list available and borrowed books, and display
 books borrowed by a specific member.
These classes form the foundation for simulating library
 operations such as lending and inventory tracking.
This code sets up sample data to test the Book,
 Member, and Library classes. It
 creates a list of book objects with predefined details, a list
    of members with unique IDs, and initializes a Library instance named "National Library"
 containing these books and members. The setup allows you to test
 core functionalities such as borrowing, returning, and tracking
 books and members.
This code tests the functionality of a basic Library Management
 System by simulating book borrowing and returning actions. It
 checks the availability of books, updates inventory accordingly,
```python
 handles edge cases (like unavailable books), and displays the
```
 borrowing status of individual members and the overall library.
```python
# Display available books in the library
```python
library.get_available_books()
```
# Alice borrows "1984"
```python
member1.borrow_book(book1)
book1.copies_available -= 1  # update inventory manually
library.get_member_books(member1)
```
# Benjamin tries to borrow "Pride and Prejudice" (no available copies)
```python
if book4.copies_available > 0:
 member2.borrow_book(book4)
 book4.copies_available -= 1
```
else:
```python
 print(f"{book4.title} is currently unavailable for borrowing.")
```
# Clara borrows "The Great Gatsby"
```python
member3.borrow_book(book3)
book3.copies_available -= 1
library.get_member_books(member3)
```
# Display borrowed books in the library
```python
library.get_borrowed_books()
```
# Display updated available books
```python
library.get_available_books()
```
# Alice returns "1984"
```python
member1.return_book(book1)
book1.copies_available += 1
library.get_member_books(member1)
```
# Display final state of borrowed and available books
```python
library.get_borrowed_books()
library.get_available_books()
```
```

```
