> I Samuel 18:5, 14, 30 NKJV
> 
> 5 So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved wisely. And Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul’s servants. 
> 
> 14 And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the Lord was with him. 
> 
> 30 Then the princes of the Philistines went out to war. And so it was, whenever they went out, that David behaved more wisely than all the servants of Saul, so that his name became highly esteemed

When you know that Daddy God loves you, you will behave wisely because you know your value in Christ. 

You know that Christ Jesus gave up His life—everything to buy you back. Bought back by His precious blood. 

So, this Christmas, remind yourself again of the real reason why Jesus came—to save us from our sin, amen.
