FEAR NOT! Little sheep, for your Good Shepherd, your Lord and Saviour encamps around you and delivers you out of all your fears.

Stop looking at your fears all look unto your Lord, Saviour and Good Shepherd.

Stop fighting the battles yourself. Let Jesus, your Lord, Saviour and Good Shepherd Who laid down His life for you fight your battles for you. Rest by letting Him fight for you as you keep feeding on His rhema word for you, amen!
