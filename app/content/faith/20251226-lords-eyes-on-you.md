> Psalm 34:15 NKJV
> 
> 15 The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,

And His ears are open to their cry.

Hey you righteous one. Yes, YOU! When you walk through the shadows of death do not fear for your Good Shepherd’s rod and staff comfort you. The rod is for the evil wolves. And the staff is to guide you away from danger. 

Your Lord and Saviour’s omnipotent eyes are on you, His righteous child. And His ears are open to your cry. 

So stop fighting the fires that little devil throws at you all the time, and let Jesus, your Lord fight your battles for you, amen!
