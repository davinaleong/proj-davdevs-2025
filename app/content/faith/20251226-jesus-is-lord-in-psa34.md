> Psalm 34:22 NKJV
> 
> 22 The Lord redeems the soul of His servants,
And none of those who trust in Him shall be condemned.

> John 8:11 NKJV
> 
> 11 She said, “No one, Lord.”

And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.”

In Psalm 34, one of the verses mentions that none of those who trust in Him shall not be condemned. 

Then in the story of the woman who was caught in adultery, Jesus gave the gift of no condemnation (Rom 8:1). 

With the authority that He had to give the gift of no condemnation and forgiveness of sins (Matt 9:2), this proves that Jesus the Lord in Psalm 34. And if He is the Lord mentioned in Psalm 34, then He is also Lord whenever the word “Lord” is used. 

So, as the Pastor Joseph Prince has mentioned before, we must let Bible interpret Bible, these 2 verses prove that Jesus is not just Lord, but God too, amen!
