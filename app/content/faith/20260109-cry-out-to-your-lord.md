Let’s learn to personalise the word for yourself.

When you are born again, God gives you the free gift of righteousness and abundance of grace. You are righteous by faith in Christ Jesus.

So, this means you are now righteous. And if you’re righteous, and you cry out, Lord Christ Jesus hears and delivers you out of all your troubles.

So, ask the Holy Spirit to show and teach you how to keep fighting from rest, amen!
