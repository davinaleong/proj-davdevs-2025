> Proverbs 28:25 NKJV
> 
> 25 He who is of a proud heart stirs up strife,

But he who trusts in the Lord will be prospered.

How can we tell if someone is proud or bold? Well, this proverb tells us how. 

A proud heart stirs up strife. But a heart that trusts in Jesus will prosper. 
That should change our perspective (or mind) on prosperity. Jesus wants us to prosper. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be recorded that those who trust in Jesus will be prospered. 

Who prospers the ones who trust in Jesus? It’s Jesus. It’s not their boss, or their company, or even their country. It’s the Lord Christ Jesus. 

So beloved, will you stop placing such a high demand on yourself and place the demand or burden on Jesus instead? Amen!
