> Proverbs 15:28 NKJV
> 
> 28 The heart of the righteous studies how to answer,
But the mouth of the wicked pours forth evil.

When we are born again, I’m sure we’ve all had that experience where the Holy Spirit convicts us when we want to lie or bear false witness, right?

So, here the verse is saying that the wicked will just say whatever comes off the top of their heads. They don’t consider the consequences of their words. 

But those who love Jesus and want to be transformed into His image by His grace will study how to answer because first, they know that they have Jesus to answer to. If they lie to those around them, they lie to Him. Secondly, they know their words carry power because of the authority Jesus gave them. And third, they don’t like and want to lie, because they know doing so will hurt their Lord and Saviour. 

It’s not that we don’t want to lie because we fear punishment from Jesus. We don’t want to and hate lying because Jesus doesn’t like us to lie. 

So, as His birthday approaches, His greatest joy is that you come home to Him. Would you like to accept Him as your Lord and Saviour?

Say the short prayer in the description. 😁

Prayer:

Lord Jesus, I acknowledge that I am a sinner and need a Saviour. I ask You to come into my life. In Your name I pray, amen.
