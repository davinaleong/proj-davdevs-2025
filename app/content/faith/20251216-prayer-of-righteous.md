> Proverbs 15:29 NKJV
>
> 29 The Lord is far from the wicked,
But He hears the prayer of the righteous.

When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, you also receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness (Rom 8:17 NKJV)

Jesus gives you the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness. This means you are now the righteousness of God in Christ. And since you are the righteousness of God in Christ, it says in the verse above, that God hears the prayer of the righteous. 

So, watch your words now, for they carry power, because God answers them, amen.
