> 22 Without counsel, plans go awry,
But in the multitude of counselors they are established.

Hey friend, before you make any major decision in your life, may I suggest that you seek wise counsel? It’s not just enough to hear the prompting of the Holy Spirit. 

If what you sensed in your heart is truly from Jesus, He’ll confirm it through the Christian friends and leaders around you. 

So, may I encourage you to get involved in a local church and seek counsel from them before going forward with any major decision in your life.

While we walk by faith and not by sight, we should also exercise wisdom for we live in a fallen world and Jesus has sent us as sheep among wolves. So, we must be wise as serpents but harmless as doves. 

So, get involved in your local Christian community, amen!
