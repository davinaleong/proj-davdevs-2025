> 
> 3 He who guards his mouth preserves his life,

But he who opens wide his lips shall have destruction.

The Bible teaches us to watch what we say. Talking too much before thinking shall lead to destruction.

So, if you want to preserve your life, guard your mouth by watching what you say, amen.
