> Psalm 34:22 NKJV
> 
> 22 The Lord redeems the soul of His servants,<br/>
> And none of those who trust in Him shall be condemned.

> Romans 8:1 NKJV
> 
> 1 There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.

When you are born again in Christ Jesus, you become part of His family, and you are in Christ. It also means that you put your trust in Him. 

Psalm 34 says that those who put their trust in Jesus shall not be condemned.

However, don’t we find our trust in Him faltering at times and even failing? Well, there’s good news in the New Covenant!

In the New Covenant bought by the precious blood of Christ Jesus, He has now given us the gift of no condemnation. 

So, stop condemning yourself when you fail and sin and walk guilt-free reckoning that your Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus bore your guilt on the cross on your behalf, amen!
