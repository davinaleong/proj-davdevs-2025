> Proverbs 13:8 NKJV
> 
> 8 The ransom of a man’s life is his riches,
> 
> But the poor does not hear rebuke.

In the 2nd half of this verse, it says that the poor does not hear rebuke.

So, the opposite would be that the rich hears rebuke.

In other words, listening to rebukes will make you rich, amen.
