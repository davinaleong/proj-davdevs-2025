> 1 Samuel 17:50 NKJV
> 
> 50 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. But there was no sword in the hand of David.

Interpretation:

* David: Jesus
* Goliath: those that use the Law to condemn Christians
* Stone: the Law (Ten Commandments)

Ever since God gave the Ten Commandments, the devil has been using it to knock believers on the head (accuse them of wrongdoing) when they have sinned. 

But, just as David used a stone to knock Goliath down, Jesus is an expert in using the Law back on those who use the Law to condemn Christians and make them think that God is still angry at them because of their sins. 

But Jesus I already took your condemnation for you and gave you the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness. So, turn away from those that condemn you of your sin and look to the One Who became sin for you on the cross, amen.
