Hey! How many people want to see good days? How many of you want to live long? Then fear or revere the Lord. 

Not to please Him out of fear, but out of the overwhelming flow of love and joy He has given to you, till you just can’t contain it anymore and just want to worship Jesus with all that He has given us. 

THAT is what will prolong days. Not dieting. Not exercise. Not living a healthy lifestyle. Not saying any of those things are bad, but the Bible says that it’s the “fear (or reverence) of the Lord” that prolongs days. 

So, let’s do all things as unto the Lord, amen!
