Hey child of Jesus, you know that you have light? Yep, Jesus is the light of the world and you are part of Him so you are also the light of the world through Him (Eph 5:8). 

So, what kind of light does the righteous have? It’s the kind that rejoices. The kind that brings favour to a store when you enter it. The kind that gives you favour with the interviewer and gets you a position of blessing. The kind that brings joy to whoever you bump into on the street. 

As you spend time with Jesus, His righteousness—the kind that rejoices will rub onto you and you’ll also reflect His joy too, amen!
