Work is a blessing. While the sweat of toilsome labour is not, it is a blessing to do something you enjoy doing. You enjoy it so much that you don’t feel laborious but instead feel joy doing it. 

That kind of labour leads to life. The labour of the righteous one that is YOU in Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit works in you the grace to work on things you enjoy doing and prosper from them.

If you allow God to partner with you in your career/working life, He might even start giving you personal revelations on how to link the your trade to the Bible!

For me, as a programmer, I see myself being the image of my Creator when I use code to create software for people to use. I’m delighted when people enjoy the software I make. 

So, I hope through this, you can find joy in your trade too, amen!
FEAR NOT! Little sheep, for your Good Shepherd, your Lord and Saviour encamps around you and delivers you out of all your fears.

Stop looking at your fears all look unto your Lord, Saviour and Good Shepherd.

Stop fighting the battles yourself. Let Jesus, your Lord, Saviour and Good Shepherd Who laid down His life for you fight your battles for you. Rest by letting Him fight for you as you keep feeding on His rhema word for you, amen!
