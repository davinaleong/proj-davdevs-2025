> Proverbs 10:21 NKJV
> 
> 21 The lips of the righteous feed many,<br/>
> But fools die for lack of wisdom.

There was none righteous on earth until Jesus came. And through Him, all those who believe in Him receive His gift of righteousness too. 

So, what does this verse say? Jesus fed multitudes with the Word, and through Him, we who are the righteousness of God in Christ can feed many, too!

We just must flow with the Holy Spirit as He guides and leads us to those who are hungry. It could be your classmate or colleague. Or it could even be the cashier as you’re paying for your items. Let’s ask the Lord to help us to be more sensitive to His “nudges”, shall we?

You never know how many lives you impact for Jesus just by being the child whom Jesus loves and giving a smile, a “thank you”, and a compliment to the people around you, amen!
