> Psalm 34:19 NKJV
> 
> 19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous,

But the Lord delivers him out of them all.

Hey beloved, do you feel like you’re being afflicted at the moment? Well, fear not little righteous one, for the Lord delivers you out of them all. 

You are righteous not because of how good or holy you are. You are righteous because Jesus gave you His righteousness and are now the righteousness of God in Christ. 

When God says you are righteous, you ARE righteous. Stop looking at your thoughts and emotions or even your doing to define your righteousness. It is Jesus’ obedience that God is looking at and putting it on your account, amen!
