> Proverbs 15:20 NKJV
> 
> 20 A wise son makes a father glad,
But a foolish man despises his mother.

This verse brings me back to a quote that Pastor Benjamin mentioned at a women’s meeting at one of the Arrow camps when I was a youth. One of his advice to the young ladies in what to look for in a man was how he treated his mother. Till this day, I remember that quote, and now I found the verse in the Bible that confirms it. 

A wise son (or daughter) makes a father glad. But a foolish man despises his mother. So the opposite would be a wise man not only makes a father glad, but cherishes his mother. 

So, do you know what makes you likeable to God? Your Daddy God? When you walk wisely. That also means you’ll make your earthly father glad, and cherish your earthly mother too! So, honour your father and mother and you’ll be wise and likeable to Daddy God, and have length of days (Prov 3:16 NKJV), amen!
