> Proverbs 15:7 NKJV
> 
> 7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge,<br/>
But the heart of the fool does not do so.

Have you ever been around people who look simply until they talk, then suddenly all their words are sound?

Those are the “wise who disperse knowledge”. And guess what, you can have the same wisdom that they have too! Just keep asking Jesus for wisdom every day. Keep depending on godly wisdom. The wisdom that gives you peace. 

When you are full of godly wisdom, you will disperse knowledge. Dispersing knowledge is the fruit of having and exercising godly wisdom. 

So, let’s keep on asking our Daddy God for godly wisdom, amen!
