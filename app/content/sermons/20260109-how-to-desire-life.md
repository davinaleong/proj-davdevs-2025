> Psalm 34:12-14 NKJV
> 
> 12 Who is the man who desires life,<br/>
> And loves many days, that he may see good?
> 
> 13 Keep your tongue from evil,
> And your lips from speaking deceit.
> 
> 14 Depart from evil and do good;
> Seek peace and pursue it.

How do you desire life and love many good days that you may see good?

Keep your tongue from speaking evil and speaking deceit like cursing, swearing and even gossiping—even on yourself, like saying negative things over yourself.

Depart from evil and do good and seek and pursue peace by not trying to always start a quarrel or a fight. Being “right” or trying to win an argument is highly overrated. Instead, ask the Holy Spirit for the wisdom to ease the tension and keep the peace, amen.
