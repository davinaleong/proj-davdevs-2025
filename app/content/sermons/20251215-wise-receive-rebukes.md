> Proverbs 15:31 NKJV
> 
> 31 The ear that hears the rebukes of life
Will abide among the wise.

How do you identify a wise person? Well according to the Bible, it’s someone who “hears the rebukes of life”. 

While there’s the part to ask Jesus for wisdom, which He will freely give and it’s the principle thing, it seems from this verse, that wisdom can also be received by choice. 

Because who likes to hear rebuke? But in this verse, it says “the ear”. Which means the we have to decide to listen to the rebukes of life instead of acting based on our thoughts and emotions. 

So, let’s learn to slow down so that we can be attentive to rebukes from the godly counsel that our Lord, Jesus has placed in our lives to love and protect us, amen?
