> Proverbs 10:4 NKJV
> 
> 4 He who has a slack hand becomes poor,<br/>
> But the hand of the diligent makes rich.

Do you want to be rich? Then get to work! Though we have a God Who freely gives to those who ask, seek, and knock, He also wants us to use; exercise the grace He first gives to us. 

As this verse says, the hand of the diligent makes rich. This means following the prompting of the Holy Spirit as He leads you. Send that resume. Go for that job interview. Be punctual for work. Honour your co-workers. Do not use God as an excuse for doing “Christian-things” during office hours, like your Bible study. 

So let’s make our Daddy proud by using the gifts, talents, grace and anointing He has given us to bless our neighbours, amen!
