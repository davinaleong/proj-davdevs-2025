> 1 Samuel 17:39 NKJV
> 
> 39 David fastened his sword to his armor and tried to walk, for he had not tested them. And David said to Saul, “I cannot walk with these, for I have not tested them.” So David took them off.

Hey, here’s an old revelation that I want to share with you. 

When you were first born again, did you ever look up to men and women of God who led you to Christ? Did you wish that you could be as spiritual and holy as the person preaching God’s word on stage?

Well when God calls you to meet a challenge He has prepared for you, He doesn’t want you to go in another person’s anointing (or armour). He wants you to go in your own anointing—the person that He made you to be. 

David didn’t defeat and kill Goliath trying to be like King Saul—going in his armour. David defeated Goliath by being himself in Christ: as a shepherd. 

So, go and defeat and conquer your trials and tribulations through the person that Jesus has created, called, and anointed you to be, amen!
