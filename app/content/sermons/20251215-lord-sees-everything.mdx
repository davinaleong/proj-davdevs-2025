> Proverbs 15:3 NKJV
> 
> 3 The eyes of the Lord are in every place,
Keeping watch on the evil and the good.

The eyes of the Lord keep watch on the evil and the good. That’s why you can rest knowing that YOU, child of God can rest, knowing that He keeps watch over you, His children. 


He also keeps watch on the evil who are your enemies, which means you don’t have to watch your back. Let Jesus, your Saviour and Lord be your rearguard watching over the evil for you, as you behold Him in His love for you. 😁


Be blessed and stay blessed, amen.
