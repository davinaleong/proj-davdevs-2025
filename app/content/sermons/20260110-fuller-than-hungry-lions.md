Can you imagine the appetite of a young lion, let alone “young lions”?

Yet the Bible says at that level of appetite that you have of need, those “who seek the Lord shall NOT lack any good thing”.

Do you know what this means? Seek Him in your valley moment. Just tell Him EVERYTHING. Cry, shout, scream, vent to Him. If He bore the wrath of Daddy God, He will bear your fury.

Other ways include joining a local church, listening to anointed, encouraging, Bible-based sermons, praying in tongues, partaking of the Holy Communion, or anointing yourself, or even reading and meditating on sound Scriptures!

So, let’s make it our priority to seek the Lord without turning it into a religion, amen!
