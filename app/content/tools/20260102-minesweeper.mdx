Play the classic Minesweeper puzzle game! Test your logic and deduction skills as you carefully navigate a minefield, using numbered clues to avoid hidden mines.

## How to Play

The goal is simple: reveal all the safe cells without clicking on any mines. Numbers on revealed cells tell you how many mines are adjacent to that cell (including diagonally).

### Controls
- **Left click**: Reveal a cell
- **Right click**: Flag or unflag a cell (marks suspected mines)
- **Numbers**: Show count of adjacent mines (1-8)
- **Empty cells**: Automatically reveal surrounding safe areas

### Game Rules
1. Click any cell to start - your first click is always safe
2. Use the numbers to deduce where mines are located
3. Right-click to flag cells you think contain mines
4. Win by revealing all safe cells (you don't need to flag all mines)
5. Lose if you click on a mine

## Difficulty Levels

Choose from three classic difficulty settings:

- **Beginner**: 9×9 grid with 10 mines - perfect for learning
- **Intermediate**: 16×16 grid with 40 mines - balanced challenge  
- **Expert**: 16×30 grid with 99 mines - for minesweeper masters

## Strategy Tips

- Start with corners and edges where there are fewer adjacent cells
- Look for patterns like "1-2-1" which often indicate mine locations
- Use the mine counter to track how many mines are left
- When a number's adjacent mines are all flagged, you can safely reveal remaining adjacent cells
- Take your time - there's no time pressure, just logic!

The mine counter at the top shows how many mines remain unflagged. Use the "New Game" button to reset anytime or switch between difficulty levels.

Good luck, and may your logic be sharp! 🧩
