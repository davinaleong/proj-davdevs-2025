## My Speaking Journey 🎤

As a passionate developer and community advocate, I've had the privilege of sharing my experiences and knowledge at various tech meetups and events across Singapore. These talks represent my commitment to knowledge sharing and giving back to the developer community that has supported my growth.

## Featured Talks

### 1. Craft CMS - Singapore PHP User Group

**Event:** Singapore PHP User Group  
**Topic:** Introduction to Craft CMS and its ecosystem  
**Video:** [Watch on Engineers.sg](https://engineers.sg/video/craft-cms-singapore-php-user-group--3235)

In this presentation, I explored Craft CMS, a powerful content management system built on PHP. I covered:
- **What makes Craft CMS unique** in the crowded CMS landscape
- **Key features and capabilities** that developers and content creators love
- **Real-world use cases** and when to choose Craft over other solutions
- **Getting started** with development and deployment
- **Best practices** for building maintainable Craft websites

This talk was particularly meaningful as it combined my passion for PHP development with practical insights from client projects where Craft CMS proved to be the perfect solution.

### 2. Journey to a Healthy Lifestyle - JuniorDevSG

**Event:** JuniorDevSG  
**Topic:** Balancing health and wellness in a developer's life

This presentation took a more personal approach, sharing my journey towards maintaining a healthy lifestyle while working in tech. Key topics included:

This talk resonated deeply with the JuniorDevSG community, sparking conversations about sustainable career practices and the importance of self-care in tech.

## Speaking Philosophy 💭

When I step onto the stage, my goal is always to:

- **Share practical knowledge** that attendees can implement immediately
- **Be authentic and honest** about both successes and failures
- **Encourage community building** and ongoing conversations
- **Make complex topics accessible** to developers of all levels
- **Inspire action** rather than just provide information

## Impact & Community Response 🌟

These speaking opportunities have been incredibly rewarding, not just for sharing knowledge but for the conversations they've sparked:

- **Connected with fellow developers** facing similar challenges
- **Received feedback** that helped improve my own practices
- **Built lasting relationships** within Singapore's tech community
- **Learned as much as I taught** through Q&A sessions and follow-up discussions

## Future Speaking Goals 🚀

I'm always looking for opportunities to share knowledge and connect with the developer community. Topics I'm excited to explore in future talks include:

- **Modern web development workflows** and tooling
- **Career growth strategies** for developers
- **Building inclusive tech communities**
- **Sustainable development practices**
- **Faith and technology** - finding purpose in our work
