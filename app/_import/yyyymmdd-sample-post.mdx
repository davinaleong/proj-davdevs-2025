When you are born again, you become part of Jesus’ family and God is on your side. So don’t be afraid when the world comes against you for when they think they’re just defying you, God sees it as defying the Holy Spirit who lives in you. 

That’s why the Bible says to pray for our enemies (Luke 6:28) less God judges them for you. 

Anyway, be blessed and stay blessed by this short sharing!
