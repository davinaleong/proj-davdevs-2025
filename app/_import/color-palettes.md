This color palette project is built with `HTML` and `CSS`, incorporating flex and CSS grid for a responsive layout. Initially utilizing `jQuery` to render color swatches from a stored `JSON` file, the palette data and color values are conveniently stored in a `JSON` file for easy modifications. The choice of `jQuery` aimed at simplicity and cleanliness.

In an October 2022 update to version 2, the project transitioned away from `jQuery` to plain JavaScript for swatch population. Version 2 includes an enhanced color details pane with buttons for easy copying of color values (Hex, RGB, or HSL) to the clipboard. Designed for user convenience, Color Palettes offers a user-friendly experience for exploring and copying color codes effortlessly.
