I created this catalogue to store all my original jokes, puns, and riddles. I went with a colourful design to keep the design simple. Click on the card to see the content.

I used this opportunity to explore NextJS and Vercel. This project is done in NextJS. The content is stored in Contentful and hosted on Vercel. After this experience, I will stick with Astro as it's simpler to set up and use. Astro is also technology agnostic.

Anyway, I hope you have lots of fun and laughter reading those jokes 😄.
