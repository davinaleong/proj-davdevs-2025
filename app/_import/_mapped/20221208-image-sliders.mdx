This is my `HTML`, `CSS` & `JS` image slider solution. I've included several other options which includes a vertical orientation. The solution uses a combination of modern `CSS` tricks and JavaScript to get the slider to work.

Basically the slides are inside a container with the `overflow` property set to `hidden`. Then I use JavaScript and `translate` to move the slides back and forth. Data attributes are used to reference the elements in JavaScript. 

This project uses what I've learned from Kevin Powell's [:has() opens up new possibilities with CSS video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJcO-IZJalQ) and Traversy Media's [Build 5 Projects With HTML, CSS & JavaScript video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkeyKeK3V24) to build these sliders. 

Feel free to use the code in your own projects! :)
