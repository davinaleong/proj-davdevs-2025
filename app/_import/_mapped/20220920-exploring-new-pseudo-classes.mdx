Here are some examples I've put together to showcase the usage of the `has()` pseudo class. You can view the code in the [repo](https://github.com/davinaleong/proj-exploring-new-pseudo-classes).

One is form states, the second is grids with an odd number of columns, and the third is carousels where the scrollbar shows when there are more than a certain number of images--in this case 5.

This project was inspired by Kevin Powell's video [Count children with CSS only using :has()! plus other awesome stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJcO-IZJalQ) once again.
