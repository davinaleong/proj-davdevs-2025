# Advice Generator App

A Frontend Mentor challenge that involved creating an advice generator app using the Advice Slip API. This project demonstrates API integration, responsive design, and clean JavaScript implementation.

## Key Features

- **API Integration**: Fetches random advice from the Advice Slip API
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices  
- **Clean UI**: Modern, minimalist interface design
- **Interactive Elements**: Smooth button interactions and loading states

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Advice Slip API
- CSS Grid & Flexbox for layout

## Challenges & Solutions

The main challenge was implementing smooth API calls with proper error handling and loading states. I solved this by creating a robust fetch function with try-catch blocks and user feedback mechanisms.
