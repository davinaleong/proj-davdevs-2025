I was tasked to develop a dashboard for clients at [LIV3LY](https://liv3ly.com/).

> **Tech Stack**
> - **Frontend:** Bootstrap, Admin LTE
> - **Deployment:** AWS S3

I decided to do an HTML template first before building the actual dashboard so that stakeholders can have an idea on how the dashboard will look like. This template is built on the [Admin LTE template](https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/index2.html).

The actual dashboard will be developed in [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/).

This template is deployed on the company's AWS S3 server.
