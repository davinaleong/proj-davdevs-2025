In my pursuit of skill enhancement, I developed a Bible API project using PHP and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). The project, hosted on Linode, comprises two integral parts: a Content Management System (CMS) and the API.

> **Tech Stack**
> - **Frontend / Backend:** Laravel
> - **Deployment:** Linode, Laravel Forge
> - **Highlights:** PHPUnit (Testing)

The CMS facilitates database updates for users, while the API efficiently retrieves stored data. Choosing the Bible as the thematic core allowed me to align the project with a familiar structure.

This remains an ongoing endeavor, with pending tasks such as domain setup and HTTPS implementation. Leveraging Laravel and deploying on [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) via [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/), the project adheres to industry standards. Rigorous testing is incorporated using Laravel's integrated [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for robust functionality.
