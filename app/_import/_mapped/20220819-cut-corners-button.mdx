I came across this [Cut Corners tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aW6qEAQSctY) by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob), and decided to try it out. I had some free time and wanted to sharpen my `CSS` skills.

The demo is [here](https://davinaleong.github.io/proj-cut-corners/) and the repo is [here](https://github.com/davinaleong/proj-cut-corners). Feel free to check it out and use the code in your own projects. While credit is appreciated, it's not needed.
