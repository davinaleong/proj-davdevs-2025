I'm trying to find ways to help laypeople understand technical jargon. My goal is to break them down into concepts they understand. Here is my first attempt at using the anatomy of the human body. To my non-technical peeps, let me know how this works out for you.

**Hardware**: Body<br/>
**Software**: Soul<br/>
**Website**: Any link you open on a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).<br/>
**Web Browser**: A software that allows you to interact with the internet.

**HTML**: Skeleton<br/>
Provides structure to a web page.

**CSS**: Makeup<br/>
Beautifies the web page.

**JavaScript (JS)**: Muscles<br/>
Makes the web page functional.

**Server-side code**: Soul<br/>
The moving parts of a large website like e-commerce (Shopee, Amazon, Alibaba, Airbnb, etc.) or social media sites (Facebook, TikTok, etc.). You don't see it, but these large websites cannot function without it.

**Database**: Memory<br/>
Stores the data of websites from blogs (DanielFoodDiary, LadyIronChef) to e-commerce sites (Shopee, Amazon, etc.) to social media sites (Facebook, TikTok, etc). Like server-side code, you don't see it, but you see its effect.
