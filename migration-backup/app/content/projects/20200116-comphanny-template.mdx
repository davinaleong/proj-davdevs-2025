This template is part one of a two-part demo for a CraftCMS talk at a local PHP meetup. It's Bootstrap 4-based with Font Awesome 5 icons. For code readability and reusability, I opted for SASS. Note: no bundled SASS compiler; consider the Live Sass Compiler VS Code extension.

Check the [write-up](https://dev.to/davinaleong/released-my-first-bootstrap-4-template-2b00) on DEV Community. Created for a fictional company, "Comphanny," specializing in web and mobile app development. The name plays on "company," "php," and "ph" pronounced as "f." Originally intended a scratch build but opted for Bootstrap due to time constraints from my day job and the upcoming CraftCMS project.
