I’m excited to share my latest mini-project — **Dav/Devs Bible Proverbs** 📖✨  
A simple, quiet web app that automatically shows **the Proverb for today**.

This app is inspired by Pastor Joseph Prince’s encouragement:

> *“There are 31 chapters in Proverbs — one for each day of the month.”*

So instead of scrolling through apps or flipping pages, you simply open the site:

- **1 Jan → Proverbs 1**  
- **29 Feb → Proverbs 29**  
- **31 Mar → Proverbs 31**

No clutter. No distractions. Just wisdom for the day.

> **Tech Stack**
>
> * **Framework:** Next.js<br />
> * **Language:** TypeScript<br />
> * **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (v4)<br />
> * **Content:** Public-domain Bible translations<br />
> * **Hosting:** Vercel<br />
> * **Focus:** Lightweight, readable, and intentionally simple

## 🎨 Themes & Reading Experience

I designed several preset themes for different preferences and contexts — from soft pinks and nature greens to newspaper-style reading and accessibility-friendly palettes.

Some highlights include:

- **Dav/Devs Light / Dav/Devs Dark** – warm and familiar  
- **Simple Light / Simple Dark** – minimal and distraction-free  
- **Daily Herald** – classic newspaper feel  
- **Teh Tarik** – cozy browns inspired by Malaysia  
- **Vision Pro Light & Dark** – optimized for color-blind users  
- **Forest Grove** – nature-inspired greens  
- **Singapore Pride & Flag Patriot** – patriotic palette  

Themes can be switched anytime, so readers can find the style they enjoy most.

## ⚙️ Customizable Settings

The app intentionally gives users control without complexity:

- Text size options  
- Favourite default theme  
- Favourite translation  
- Configurable date format  
- Option to save preferences in the browser  
- Reset-to-defaults button

Everything is focused on **comfort, clarity, and ease of use**.

## 🙏 Heart Behind This Project

This wasn’t built to be fancy.

It was built to help people (including myself) **consistently sit with God’s wisdom**, without friction or overwhelm.

If this app encourages even one person each morning, that makes the work worthwhile. 💛

Thanks for reading, and I hope Dav/Devs Bible Proverbs blesses you the same way it blessed me while building it.
