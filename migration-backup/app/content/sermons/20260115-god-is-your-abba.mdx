> Romans 8:15 NKJV

> 15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.”

Do you realise what it means to be a child of God? Do you know what it means to have God as your Father—your Daddy—your Abba?

Think about it. Before you were born again, you were all alone, having to fend for yourself against the devil. BUT! When you accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, you become part of Jesus’ family, and God becomes your Father—your Daddy. The Creator and Judge of the universe is now your Daddy! Can you comprehend this?!

So, picture this—how would you feel as a parent when your neighbour, relative, grandparents or even your helper tries to tell you how to handle your child? How much more that puny devil trying to bully you or telling God how to handle you. Do you think God, your Daddy God, likes it?

So, this should give you the confidence to cry out to your big, big Daddy God whenever that puny bully called the devil comes to point out your sins to you, amen.
