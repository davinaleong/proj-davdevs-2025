Despise the word and be destroyed. But fear it and be rewarded. 

I can testify to this in my life. There was a season in my life when I was just doing anything that came to my head and heart thinking they were from Jesus and I fell. 

But I thank the Holy Spirit because He picked me up by prompting me to get back into the word. So I went on a 4-year Bible plan and now I find my life is on track again. 

This underscores the truth that getting into the word is so important. Not to please God, but to know what Jesus died to give us, amen.
