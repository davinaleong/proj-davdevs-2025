> Proverbs 15:29 NKJV
> 
> 29 The Lord is far from the wicked,<br/>
> But He hears the prayer of the righteous.

> 2 Corinthians 5:21 NKJV
> 
> 21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.

Do you know why your words, your prayers carry power right now, oh child of God?

That’s because you are the righteousness of God in Christ. 

Proverbs 15:29 says that the Lord hears the prayer of the righteous, and in 2 Corinthians 5:21 says that God made His only begotten Son Who knew no sin, to be sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of God in Christ. 

So, from now on, watch your tongue, child of God for your words carry power, amen!
