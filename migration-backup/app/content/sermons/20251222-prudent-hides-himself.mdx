> Proverbs 22:3 NKJV
> 
> A prudent man foresees evil and hides himself,
> 
> But the simple pass on and are punished.

Did you know that some evils in your life can be avoided? Yep, with wisdom, you can!

In this verse, it says that a “prudent man foresees evil and hides himself”. This means prudent people can foresee what’s going to happen before it happens through godly wisdom and hide themselves before the evil approaches. 

That’s why the Bible says to be wise as serpents because Jesus is sending us as sheep among wolves (Matt 10:16 NKJV).

So, let’s keep asking our good Shepherd for wisdom, amen?
