> 1 Samuel 17:10, 26 NKJV
> 
> 10 And the Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.” 
> 
> 26 Then David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”

When you are born again, you become part of Jesus’ family and God is on your side. So don’t be afraid when the world comes against you for when they think they’re just defying you, God sees it as defying the Holy Spirit who lives in you. 

That’s why the Bible says to pray for our enemies (Luke 6:28) less God judges them for you. 

Anyway, be blessed and stay blessed by this short sharing!
