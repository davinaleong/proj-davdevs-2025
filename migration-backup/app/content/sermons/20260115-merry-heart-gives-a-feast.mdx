> Proverbs 15:15 NKJV
> 
> 15 All the days of the afflicted are evil,<br/>
> But he who is of a merry heart has a continual feast.

> Nehemiah 8:10 NKJV
> 
> 10 Then he said to them, “Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not sorrow, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.”

How do you continually have a merry heart? Especially in your dark and valley moments? By turning to the Lord. Let His joy be your strength. Then you can continually have a merry heart.

Then when you have a merry heart, you shall have a continual feast. A continual feast of giants based on the reckoning that you have a big, big Daddy God. Because where the giants are, the fruits are too. Just as the two spies collected giant grapes from the city of the giants—Jericho, you shall collect giant fruits from the giants you shall conquer and overcome this year through Christ, for we can do ALL things through Him (Phil 4:13), amen!
